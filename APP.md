# Building our app

Now that we have laid the ground work for our app, lets build a way to run it!
In order to do that, we need to add some scripts to our `package.json` file.

```
 "scripts": {
   "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
   "dev": "nodemon --exec babel-node index.js",
   "start": "yarn run dev"
 },
```

For now, **start** is going to run **dev**, and dev is going to look at
`index.js` in the root for instruction and use _nodemon_ to automatically
restart the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

---

### Creating our server

Create a `server` folder and inside that an `index.js` file:

ie: `./server/index.js`

Remember that API key and secret we est up in our `.env` file? We're finally
going to use them!

In `./server/index.js`:

```
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();
```

FYI - config will read your `.env` file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content
or an error key if it failed.

Next, we're going to add a packaged called Koa to our project

`yarn add koa`

Koa is a minimalistic node framework for modern Javascript apps. It is built
around the ES2016 `async` and `await` keywords.

In Koa you express your application logic as a series of asynchronous functions
called middleware, which is just a fancy word for functions that all operate on
a `context` or `ctx` object, and await on a `next` function to yield flow back
into the rest of the app.

Lets console.log a simple â€˜Hello Friendsâ€™ middleware to make sure everything is
working. More documentation can be found in the
[Koa documentation](https://github.com/koajs/koa#hello-koa)

```
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import Koa from 'koa';

dotenv.config();

const app = new Koa();

app.use(function index(ctx) {
 console.log('Hello Friends ðŸ‘‹');
 ctx.body = 'Hello Friends ðŸ‘‹';
});

export default app;
```

(ADD INSTRUCTIONS HERE ON WHERE THIS CAN BE FOUND)

Now, lets add an `index.js` file at the root level of our project.

In the file, start a server listening for connections on a given port, we are
going to use `port 3000.`

```
import server from './server';

const {PORT = 3000} = process.env;

server.listen(PORT, () => {
 console.log(`ðŸš€ Listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### Exposing our dev environment to the internet

At Shopify we typically use ngrok as a tunnel. You will need to download ngrok
at [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download) and signup for a
free account. Move the unziped ngrok client to your user folder and run the
following in your terminal.

```bash
$ ./ngrok http 3000
```

This should display a UI in your terminal with the public URL of your tunnel and
other status and metrics information about connections made over your tunnel. It
should something like this: ![image of ngrok](assets/ngrok.png)

FYI: This basically takes whatever is running on `locahost:3000` and puts it on
that `ngrok` url. You could send that url to a friend and they could take a look
at your work, or you could use it as the URL in your Shopify Partner account!

---

### Setting up our URL on the partners dashboard

Now that we've exposed our development enviroment to ngrok, lets go ahead and
add that url to the
[Shopify Partners dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/organizations).

Once you're logged into the Shopify Partners dashboard click "Apps" from the
main dashboard navigation. Find your version of the `cool-fun-example-app` (the
same place we got our API_KEY from earlier)

Set the app URL to the public URL of your ngrok tunnel. This should be displayed
in the UI under "Fowarding" and should end with `.ngrok.io` for example
`https://e3fd01a0.ngrok.io`.

In this guide we'll be using `/auth/callback` as our oauth callback route, so
add that to your whitelist.

### Starting the app

Ensure your packages are up to date by running `yarn install` and then your
start command, which should be `yarn start`

Open a browser and go to either [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) or the url
provided by ngrok.

If successful, you should see a hello message in your browser (that you set up
via scaffolding, right?).

---

### Lets build the app!

#### Step 1: Auth

So, earlier we set up our middlewear with Koa. That works just fine, we've seen
our hello friends.

We're not going to use koa to authenticate ourselves and have our app show
itself in the Shopify store. Shopify has it's own koa-auth package that we will
use:

```bash
yarn add koa-session @shopify/koa-shopify-auth
```

FYI: You can learn more about the this package
[here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/koa-shopify-auth).

In our `./server/index.js` add the following lines to your file:

```js
import session from 'koa-session';
import createShopifyAuth from '@shopify/koa-shopify-auth';
```

We can mount our middlware by adding the following lines after we intialize our
new Koa app.

```js
app.use(session(app));
```

We are mounting the session middleware and passing our Koa app instance into it.

Next we need to use the Shopify Auth Middleware. To configure it we'll need to
pass the apiKey, and our secret.

We can grab both our `SHOPIFY_SECRET` and `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` from the
environment. Remember that `dotenv` package? That's helping us out here.

```js
const { SHOPIFY_API_KEY, SHOPIFY_SECRET } = process.env;
```

Then we'll add the middleware to the app and pass in some configuration.

```js
app.use(
  createShopifyAuth({
    // your shopify app's api key
    apiKey: SHOPIFY_API_KEY,
    // your shopify app's api secret
    secret: SHOPIFY_SECRET,
    // our app's permissions
    // we need to write products to the user's store, there are more permissions you can add
    scopes: ['write_products'],
    // our own custom logic after authentication has completed
    afterAuth(ctx) {
      const { shop, accessToken } = ctx.session;

      console.log('We did it!', shop, accessToken);

      ctx.redirect('/');
    }
  })
);
```

`afterAuth` here tells our app what to do when an authentication successfully
completes. We will just print a message and redirect to the root or our app.

With this done, we'll add `app.keys` to let us use session securely. Set this to
your Shopify secret before we mount our session middleware.

```js
app.keys = [SHOPIFY_SECRET];
```

To try out our authenticate flow, lets visit
`YOUR_HTTPS_NGROK_URL/auth?shop=YOUR_SHOP_DOMAIN`.

You might see an error screen that states:

```
Oauth error invalid_request: The redirect_uri is not whitelisted
```

(OAUTH SCREENSHOT HERE)

To solve this we need to login to our partners dashboard, go to our App Info and
add `YOUR_HTTPS_NGROK_URL/auth/callback` to "Whitelisted redirection URL(s)"
textarea.

Now if you try to authenicate again,
(`YOUR_HTTPS_NGROK_URL/auth?shop=YOUR_SHOP_DOMAIN`) it should take you to
install the app in the Shopify admin. Once its installed you can verify it shows
by going to to `YOUR_SHOPIFY_URL/admin/apps`.

We now have an authentication route, but users can still go straight to our
index without logging in. You can verifiy this by clearing your cookies or
loading the your ngrok url in an icognito tab. The next step will protect our
`Hello friends` with a verification middleware.

The `@shopify/koa-shopify-auth` package exports a middleware for this exact
purpose. For more info
[here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/koa-shopify-auth)

```js
import createShopifyAuth, { verifyRequest } from '@shopify/koa-shopify-auth';
```

_server/index.js_

Now we can add the following between our Auth and Hello friends middlewares.

```js
// secure all middleware after this line
//what is the difference between creatVerifyRequest and verifyRequest? I'm using verifyRequest
app.use(verifyRequest());
```

Everything below this middleware will require authentication, everything above
will not.

ðŸŽ‰Congratulations!ðŸŽ‰ You have just built a app that will render in the Shopify
admin and knows how to authenicate with Shopify. Now lets actually work on
making our app do something.
